Xcode

- Version: 11.4.1

# MyProject (Diary) is the main project that is being developed
---
## The project is combining the functions of Reminder, Diary and List. Since all these things are separate apps on mobile phones at present, my idea is that they can be grouped together to make it more convenient for users to use. This can be used by anyone who needs it.
